MORBUS_BRICK is done via blue.gray.util.handlers.EventHandler
MORBUS_BEDROCK is a 'ore' generated on bedrock <- has no use so far
MORBUS is all about hurting / getting hurt dark and stuff

The MORBUS TOOL set will include a AIOT(a all-in-one-tool)
The Idea of the Tools will be inspired by Blood Magic but different
Right Clicking the Tools will Add a Value to the Tool
Which will be prioritized before the durability
What does right click cost: blood ofc or pain fits also

Hitting a Tree on the start hurts.. maaaybee i can add a little something
